# **An Analytical Deep Dive into the Clash Royale Economy (Post-2025 Overhaul): A Foundational Report for Simulation**

## **Section 1: Foundational Progression Systems: Cards & Tower Troops**

The core of the *Clash Royale* economy is built upon a foundation of collectible and upgradable assets. These assets, primarily Cards and the more recently introduced Tower Troops, serve as the primary sinks for player-accumulated resources. Understanding the precise costs, constraints, and mechanics of this foundation is paramount for constructing an accurate economic simulation. The post-2025 economic landscape has bifurcated this progression into a standard path governed by Gold and duplicate cards, and an endgame path dominated by a specialized currency, Elite Wild Cards.

### **1.1 Card Taxonomy and Level Structure**

The game's strategic layer is defined by its diverse roster of cards, which are categorized into five distinct rarities: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Champion.1 This rarity classification is not a direct measure of a card's power but rather an indicator of its acquisition difficulty and the uniqueness of its mechanics.3 Indeed, many highly competitive decks utilize a core of Common and Rare cards, underscoring that strategic utility is independent of rarity.1 The primary exception to this principle is the Champion rarity; these cards possess powerful, player-activated abilities and are limited to one per deck, giving them a unique strategic weight.3

All cards in the game progress along a unified leveling structure, culminating at a maximum of Level 15\.6 This progression is divided into two distinct phases. The primary path encompasses Levels 1 through 14, where upgrades follow a traditional resource model. The final step, from Level 14 to 15, is designated the "Elite Level" and utilizes an entirely different economic loop, which will be detailed further in this report.6 This structure creates separate mid-game and endgame progression goals, each with its own resource bottlenecks and player incentives.

### **1.2 The Standard Upgrade Path (Levels 1-14): Resource Requirements**

Advancing a card from Level 1 to Level 14 requires the expenditure of two fundamental resources: duplicate copies of the specific card and Gold.2 The quantity of both resources needed for each subsequent level increases exponentially, creating a steep progression curve. This dual-cost system means players can be gated by either a lack of specific cards or a shortage of Gold. Historically, Gold has proven to be the more significant long-term bottleneck for the majority of the player base, a factor that heavily influenced the design of the Elite Level system.8

For a simulation to accurately model player progression, the precise costs for each level and rarity are essential. The following tables consolidate available data on these requirements. The total Gold cost to upgrade a single card from its base level to Level 14 is substantial: approximately 240,625 for a Common card, 240,600 for a Rare, 239,400 for an Epic, 230,000 for a Legendary, and 210,000 for a Champion.9

| 13 \-\> 14 | 20 | 100,000 | 30 | 210,000 |

Note: The above tables are constructed from multiple data sources and represent the current understanding of the upgrade economy.5 Base levels for cards are Level 1 (Common), Level 3 (Rare), Level 6 (Epic), Level 9 (Legendary), and Level 11 (Champion).11

### **1.3 The Elite Level (Level 15): The Endgame Resource Sink**

The progression to Level 15, the Elite Level, represents a fundamental shift in the game's economy. This final upgrade costs **zero Gold**.12 Instead, it requires a new, dedicated endgame currency:

**Elite Wild Cards (EWCs)**. The cost is a flat **50,000 EWCs** for any card, irrespective of its rarity.6 This design was a direct response to player feedback concerning the prohibitive Gold costs associated with maxing out cards to Level 14\.8

EWCs are primarily obtained through the conversion of surplus resources. Once a card reaches Level 14, any additional duplicates of that card collected by the player are automatically converted into EWCs.7 The conversion rates are highly asymmetrical and are a critical component of the endgame economic model:

* **Common Card:** 1 EWC  
* **Rare Card:** 5 EWCs  
* **Epic Card:** 20 EWCs  
* **Legendary Card:** 1500 EWCs  
* **Champion Card:** 4000 EWCs

Magic Items, such as Wild Cards and Books, also convert to EWCs at these same rates, but only once a player has upgraded all cards of that item's rarity to Level 14\.7

This economic structure creates a powerful, non-obvious incentive for endgame players. The most efficient path to accumulating the 50,000 EWCs required for an Elite Level upgrade is not by acquiring surplus high-rarity cards, but by maxing out all Common cards first. A Level 14 Common card effectively becomes an "EWC factory," converting every subsequent duplicate—a very frequent reward—into EWCs at a 1:1 ratio. In contrast, a surplus Legendary card yields only 1500 EWCs and is acquired far less frequently. This system subtly encourages players to shift their resource allocation from specializing in a single high-level deck to diversifying their collection and upgrading all low-rarity cards to Level 14\. This broadens the player's usable card pool and simultaneously maximizes their EWC generation rate, creating a self-reinforcing loop that rewards collection completion over hyper-specialization.

### **1.4 The Tower Troop System: A Parallel Progression Path**

Introduced in late 2023, the Tower Troop system adds a new layer of strategic customization by allowing players to change the troop that defends their Crown Towers.13 These cards, such as the default Tower Princess, the defensive Cannoneer, or the support-oriented Royal Chef, do not occupy one of the eight standard deck slots, functioning as a ninth, specialized card.13

Tower Troops are primarily acquired via Lucky Drops, the game's current primary reward mechanism.13 Their upgrade path closely mirrors that of standard cards. From Levels 1 to 14, they require a combination of duplicate Tower Troop cards and Gold. The final upgrade to the Elite Level (Level 15\) also costs 50,000 EWCs.13 Magic Items, including Wild Cards and Magic Coins, can be applied to Tower Troops to accelerate their progression.13

A critical balancing mechanic is hard-coded into this system: a Tower Troop's level in battle is capped by the player's current King Tower Level.13 A player's King Level increases by gaining Experience Points (XP), which are primarily earned by upgrading and donating a wide variety of cards.16 This link between Tower Troop level and King Level serves as a crucial gate against pay-to-win scenarios. A player cannot simply purchase enough resources to max out a Cannoneer on a low-level account and gain an insurmountable advantage. The power of their tower is inextricably tied to their overall account maturity and the time and resources invested across their entire card collection. This ensures that this new axis of power progression remains paced with the game's established, long-term economic loops.

#### **Table 1.2: Tower Troop Upgrade Costs (Levels 1-15)**

## **Section 2: The Modern Reward Engine: Daily Engagement and Lucky Drops**

The most significant overhaul to the *Clash Royale* economy in recent years was the complete removal of the chest-based reward system in March 2025\. This change fundamentally altered the player's daily engagement loop, moving from a passive, appointment-based model to an active, probability-driven system designed to maximize daily playtime and retention.

### **2.1 Deconstruction of the "RIP Chests" Update (March 2025\)**

The "RIP Chests" update removed several long-standing features, including the chest cycle, the four chest slots, all chest timers, and related Magic Items like Chest Keys.18 The rationale provided by the developers was to eliminate friction points in the player experience. The time delay between winning a battle and receiving the reward was seen as a negative, interrupting the "moment of success." Furthermore, the need to log in multiple times per day simply to manage the chest queue was identified as a chore, particularly for casual players.18

This change marked a seismic shift from a semi-deterministic system to a probabilistic one. The old 500-chest cycle provided players with a predictable roadmap of future rewards, guaranteeing the acquisition of high-value chests like the Super Magical or Royal Wild Chest over a set number of wins.19 The new system replaces this predictability with immediate, but highly variable, rewards. The community response was polarized, with some players appreciating the immediacy while others expressed concern over a perceived reduction in overall rewards and a loss of transparency.22

### **2.2 Daily Battle Rewards Mechanics**

The core of the new system is the Daily Battle Rewards, which provides a tiered structure of rewards based on the number of battles won each day in most game modes.18 The structure is as follows:

* **Wins 1-3:** Lucky Drop \+ Bonus Reward \+ Crowns  
* **Wins 4-10:** Bonus Reward \+ Crowns  
* **Wins 11+:** Crowns only

Initially, Bonus Rewards provided a small, direct injection of either Gold or cards, with specified probabilities for each.18 However, a key adjustment in the June 2025 update streamlined this system, changing Bonus Rewards to grant

**Gold only**.24 This change further concentrates the acquisition of non-Gold progression items (like cards, Wild Cards, and Magic Items) into the Lucky Drop system. This tiered reward structure creates a strong incentive for players to achieve at least 10 wins per day to maximize their resource income, directly tying daily progression to active and successful gameplay.

### **2.3 Lucky Drops: A Deep Dive into the Probabilistic Reward Core**

Lucky Drops are the centerpiece of the modern reward engine and the primary source for all high-value progression items, including Legendary cards, Champions, Tower Troops, and Card Evolutions.13 The system is a multi-layered random number generation (RNG) process that must be modeled in stages for an accurate simulation.

**1\. Starting Rarity:** Players can earn three Lucky Drops per day from their first three wins. The rarity of the drop at the start of the opening sequence is predetermined: the first daily drop begins as a 2-star item, while the second and third begin as 1-star items.18

**2\. Upgrade Mechanic:** Each Lucky Drop undergoes a series of "taps" or "spins" (typically four) during its opening animation. With each tap, there is a chance for the drop to upgrade to a higher star rating. The probabilities for these upgrades were adjusted with the introduction of the system to create a specific outcome distribution.18 For example, a 4-star drop now has a small chance to upgrade to a 5-star drop, which was not previously possible. This multi-stage reveal is a common engagement mechanic designed to build anticipation and excitement.

**3\. Final Reward Pool:** The final star rating achieved after all taps determines the specific pool of potential rewards and their associated probabilities. Higher star ratings unlock access to rarer and more valuable items. For instance, a 1-star drop will most likely contain Gold or a small number of random cards, whereas a 5-star drop guarantees a high-tier reward like a Book of Books or a full Card Evolution.26

This entire reward structure is engineered to function as a powerful variable-ratio reinforcement schedule, the same psychological principle that makes slot machines compelling. By replacing the predictable chest cycle with the high variance of Lucky Drops, the system creates a daily habit loop. Players are motivated to complete their first three wins each day not just for the guaranteed resources, but for the chance at a "jackpot" reward. This unpredictability is more psychologically engaging and more effective at driving daily retention than a fixed reward schedule.

Furthermore, the deliberate funneling of progression-accelerating items into this RNG-based system is a significant economic choice. As other reward sources like Bonus Rewards and certain chests were streamlined to provide primarily Gold and basic cards 24, Lucky Drops became the near-exclusive channel for obtaining Wild Cards, Magic Items, and Evolutions. This increases the perceived value of a high-rarity Lucky Drop and may indirectly encourage monetization from players who wish to bypass the inherent randomness of the system by purchasing guaranteed resources from the in-game shop.

#### **Table 2.1: Lucky Drop Upgrade Probabilities per "Spin"**

| Current Tier | Chance to Upgrade to 3-Star | Chance to Upgrade to 4-Star | Chance to Upgrade to 5-Star |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **2-Star Start** | 24.00% | 20.00% | 6.00% |
| **3-Star Start** | \- | 20.00% | 2.00% |
| **4-Star Start** | \- | \- | 4.00% |

## **Section 3: Macro-Economic Loops: Long-Term Progression Pathways**

Beyond the daily engagement loop, *Clash Royale*'s economy is structured by several macro-level progression systems that define a player's long-term journey. The June 2025 update fundamentally redesigned these pathways, creating a distinct three-stage funnel that guides players from the early game through a repeatable seasonal endgame and into an exclusive competitive peak.

### **3.1 The Reworked Trophy Road (0-10,000 Trophies)**

The Trophy Road is the primary progression path for new and intermediate players. In the June 2025 update, this path was significantly extended from its previous cap to a new maximum of 10,000 trophies.24 This expansion introduced new Arenas, such as Valkalla at 9,000 trophies, with the stated goal of alleviating player congestion in the heavily populated 5,000 to 8,000 trophy range.24

This system functions as a one-time source of milestone rewards that players collect as they climb.28 A crucial economic change tied to this rework was the redistribution of in-game resources. Notably, 2,525 Gems were moved from the grind-intensive Card Mastery system and placed onto the Trophy Road.24 This makes the premium currency significantly more accessible to all players during their initial progression, accelerating their early-game experience. For simulation purposes, the Trophy Road represents a finite, front-loaded injection of a wide variety of resources that every new player account will receive.

### **3.2 Seasonal Arenas (10,000-15,000+ Trophies)**

Upon reaching 10,000 trophies, players graduate from the one-time Trophy Road and enter the Seasonal Arenas, a new, repeatable endgame ladder.25 This system introduces several unique mechanics designed for high-level play:

* **Accelerated Trophy Gain:** Between 10,000 and 14,999 trophies, wins and losses are worth a scaled value of ±150 trophies, a fivefold increase from the standard \~±30.24 This dramatically accelerates the pace of climbing, making the 5,000-trophy journey feel more akin to a 1,000-trophy climb under the old system.25  
* **Seasonal Reset:** At the conclusion of each season, players' trophies are partially reset. The reset places players within a 10,000 to 12,000 trophy range, based on their final position in the previous season.24 This prevents a full rollback and keeps the competition fresh each month.  
* **Centralized Resource Hub:** The Seasonal Arenas have become the new primary source for endgame resources that were previously located elsewhere. Each season, this mode offers rewards including 10,000 Elite Wild Cards and 50,000 Gold, which were redistributed from the game's top competitive mode.24

This system effectively creates the main macro-progression loop for the majority of the committed, high-level player base. The primary goal within this loop is to climb to 15,000 trophies each season to unlock rewards and gain access to the game's premier competitive mode.

### **3.3 Ranked Mode (Formerly Path of Legends)**

Ranked Mode is the pinnacle of competition in *Clash Royale*. Formerly known as Path of Legends, this mode was repositioned in the June 2025 update as a more exclusive and prestigious environment.24 Access is now gated and must be earned each season. A player can unlock Ranked Mode by either reaching 15,000 trophies in the Seasonal Arenas during the current season or by having finished in the Champion league or higher during the

*previous* season.24

Coinciding with this change in accessibility, the reward structure of Ranked Mode was rebalanced. The lower leagues (Challenger I, II, and III) were removed to shorten the path to the top.24 A significant portion of its bulk resource rewards were redistributed to the more accessible Seasonal Arenas and Events. The mode now contains a total of 25,000 EWCs and 25,000 Gold per season, with the remainder moved to other game modes.24

This restructuring transforms the player journey into a clear, three-stage funnel. New players progress through the finite Trophy Road. They then enter the repeatable Seasonal Arena loop, which serves as the primary endgame grind for resources. Finally, by demonstrating mastery in the Seasonal Arenas, they earn a "ticket" to the exclusive Ranked Mode, which offers the most prestigious accolades (such as leaderboard placements that qualify for the Clash Royale League) but is no longer the primary engine of economic progression for most players.31

This economic rebalancing, particularly the redistribution of EWCs, addresses a critical issue of resource stagnation for the "near-elite" player base. Previously, a large quantity of EWCs was locked in the highest echelons of Path of Legends, accessible only to a very small percentage of top players.24 This created a "rich get richer" dynamic, making it difficult for players just outside this elite tier to acquire the necessary resources for Elite Level upgrades. By moving a combined 25,000 EWCs per season into the more accessible Seasonal Arenas and Events, the system makes the endgame progression to Level 15 feel more attainable for a much broader segment of the dedicated player base, likely improving long-term retention among this crucial demographic.

## **Section 4: Currencies, Resources, and Monetization Interfaces**

The *Clash Royale* economy is powered by a complex web of currencies and resources, each with specific acquisition methods and use cases. These resources are distributed through gameplay and can also be acquired directly or indirectly through monetization via the in-game Shop and the Pass Royale system.

### **4.1 Resource Compendium**

A comprehensive simulation must track the flow of several distinct resources:

* **Gold:** The primary soft currency. It is used for all card upgrades from Level 1 to 14 and for purchasing cards and other items from the Shop. Gold is sourced from nearly every game activity, including battle rewards, donations, and various reward chests and drops.32  
* **Gems:** The premium hard currency. Gems are used to purchase special chests, emotes, and offers from the Shop, and to enter certain challenges and tournaments. They are primarily acquired through real-money purchases but are also distributed in small quantities through the Trophy Road and Lucky Drops.32  
* **Elite Wild Cards (EWCs):** The dedicated endgame currency used exclusively for upgrading cards from Level 14 to the Elite Level (15). Sourced from surplus Level 14 cards and specific high-end rewards.7  
* **Wild Cards & Magic Items:** This category includes progression accelerators that provide flexibility. Wild Cards can substitute for any card of their corresponding rarity. Magic Items include Books (which provide all remaining cards needed for the next level), Magic Coins (which cover the Gold cost of an upgrade), and Trade Tokens (which facilitate card trades with clanmates).32 The strategic use of these items, such as using a Book of Books on a high-level Champion, can provide immense value.34  
* **Evolution Shards & Wild Shards:** A highly specific resource required to unlock Card Evolutions, which grant powerful new abilities to existing cards. Six shards of a specific card are needed to unlock its Evolution. Wild Shards can be used as a substitute for one shard of any card.7

### **4.2 The In-Game Shop**

The Shop is the central hub for monetization and direct resource acquisition.33 Its interface is designed to present players with a wide variety of purchasing opportunities:

* **Daily Deals:** A section that refreshes every 24 hours, offering free daily gifts (such as Gold, Gems, or a chest) alongside a rotating selection of cards and emotes available for purchase with Gold or Gems.33  
* **Special Offers:** These are time-limited bundles that typically package various resources (e.g., chests, Gold, Magic Items, Evolution Shards) and are sold for real money. These offers are often marketed with a "value multiplier" (e.g., "5x Value") to signal their discount compared to purchasing the items individually.33 The shop may also feature Personal Offers, which are tailored to a player's specific progression level and purchasing history.35  
* **Hoggy Bank:** A recurring, monetized feature where players accumulate a bonus pool of Gold or Gems through their regular gameplay. Once a milestone is reached, the player can purchase the contents of the bank for real money.33  
* **Currency Exchange:** The shop provides a direct way to purchase Gem packs with real money and to convert those Gems into Gold.33

### **4.3 Pass Royale: A Multi-Tiered Reward System**

Pass Royale is the game's battle pass system and a core component of its monetization strategy. It is offered in three tiers:

1. **Free Pass:** Available to all players, offering a baseline of rewards unlocked by earning Crowns from battles.  
2. **Gold Pass:** A paid tier (currently $5.99 USD) that includes all Free Pass rewards plus a significant number of additional high-value items, including Wild Cards, Magic Items, exclusive cosmetics, and quality-of-life perks.36  
3. **Diamond Pass:** The highest paid tier (currently $11.99 USD) that includes all rewards from the Free and Gold passes, plus additional Gems, chests, and premium cosmetics like animated battle banners.36

The Pass Royale provides a structured, high-value resource stream for paying players. For a simulation, it represents a predictable and substantial monthly resource injection that differentiates the progression speed of a paying player from a free-to-play user.

The series of economic updates in 2025 has sharpened the game's monetization focus. With the removal of chest timers, a primary sink for Gems used to "time-skip" progression was eliminated. The new economy, with its reliance on the high-variance Lucky Drop system for top-tier rewards, shifts the value proposition of monetization. Shop offers and the Pass Royale are now compelling because they provide *guaranteed* resources, allowing players to mitigate the randomness of the core reward loop. Players are incentivized to spend not just to accelerate progress, but to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the free-to-play path.

Concurrently, the supply of freely obtainable premium currency has been strategically tightened. The number of Gems available from repeatable endgame sources like the Diamond Pass (reduced from 1,525 to 225\) and Card Masteries was significantly curtailed.18 While some of these Gems were reallocated to the one-time Trophy Road, the overall renewable supply for veteran players has decreased. This increases the relative value of each Gem and strengthens the incentive for direct Gem purchases from the shop, reinforcing the direct monetization loop.
